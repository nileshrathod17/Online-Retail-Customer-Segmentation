# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
We endeavour to find the various customer segments using the online retail store's transaction data obtained from UCI Machine Learning Dataset repository. This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.
